# DNN-for-Face-and-Signature-Recognition
1. This represents the culmination of my year-long project, incorporating a Flask application.
2. Within this application, it processes two types of images: facial images and signature images.
3. The application is proficient at identifying both faces and signatures within the uploaded images.
4. Consequently, this project showcases the practical application of image detection, a feature that can be employed in online exam application forms to ensure flawless admit card generation.
